      <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Project">Hydra</a> application&mdash;supports accessioning, arrangement, description, discovery, delivery, and long term preservation of born digital archival collections. This instance of Hypatia is a <b>prototype</b> of the open source software, and is meant to demonstrate the potential of managing digital archives holistically, in a repository-powered platform. It includes parts of 14 digital collections developed as part of the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/">AIMS Project</a> (&ldquo;Born-Digital Collections: An Inter-Institutional Model for Stewardship&rdquo;), funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The full contents of each of these collections are hosted at their respective home institutions.</p>
