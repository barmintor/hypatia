h1. Hydra-Head

Hydra-Head is a Rails Engines plugin containing the core code for a Hydra application.  The full hydra stack includes the following:

Hydra-head is a Rails plugin that depends upon and extends Blacklight.  Wherever possible, hydra-head relies on Blacklight's views and styling.  This means that while hydra-head provides a lot of unique functionality, you will only get something that looks like a complete application when you combine hydra-head with Blacklight in a Rails application.  

- "Blacklight":http://projectblacklight.org/  (a rails engines plugin) for the User Interface
- "Fedora":http://fedora-commons.org/ (a java web application) for the digital content repository
- "Solr":http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ (a java web application, also ported to other languages) for the Search Engine 
- "ActiveFedora":https://github.com/mediashelf/active_fedora (a ruby gem) to let the rails application talk to Fedora.  Somewhat analogous to ActiveRecord in Rails. 
- "OM (Opinionated Metadata)":https://github.com/mediashelf/om (a ruby gem) to streamline the translation from XML metadata and ruby objects (avoid XPath!)
- "Solrizer":https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer (a ruby gem) to write content to the Solr index
- "SolrizerFedora":https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer-fedora (a ruby gem) to write Fedora content to the Solr index.
- HydraHead (this rails engines plugin) to glue it all together 

For a more thorough overview of the Hydra framework, see "HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea/blob/master/HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile.

This is (currently) a Ruby on Rails 2 Engines Plugin.  It will soon become a Rails 3 Plugin, which will be distributed as a gem.

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia, and University of Hull.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, and Chris Awre.  

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
