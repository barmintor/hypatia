h1. Getting Started Building Your Own Hydra Application


*!!! This is a WORK IN PROGRESS !!!*

h3. What you will learn form this document:

Set up a Hydra application (a rails app that uses the hydra-head plugin) and run it
Define a new Content Type called JournalArticle
# Define the ActiveFedora Model for JournalArticles
# Index JournalArticles into solr
# Customize how JournalArticles appear in search results
# Define JournalArticles “show” view
# Define JournalArticles “edit” view 

h2. Set up a Hydra Application

For the purposes of this tutorial, we have set up a preconfigured rails app that you can download from github.

!!! link to download the preconfigured rails app

For now, see "CREATE_RAILS_APP":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/blob/master/CREATE_RAILS_APP.textile.

h3. Starting the App out of the Box

h4. (1) Migrate the development databases.

From the rails application root directory:

<pre>
  rake db:migrate
</pre>  

h4. (2) Start Jetty, pre-configured with Fedora and Solr

_Stop any copies of jetty (or anything else using port 8983) before running this command._
(Note that java 1.6 must be invoked by the "java" command or Fedora won't work.)

<pre>
  rake hydra:jetty:start
</pre>  

This will start up a pre-configured jetty instance running Fedora and Solr on port 8983.

Ensure Solr is running:  "http://localhost:8983/solr/development/admin":http://localhost:8983/solr/development/admin should show the Solr admin page.  You should be able to click on the Statistics link (or go to "http://localhost:8983/solr/development/admin/stats.jsp":http://localhost:8983/solr/development/admin/stats.jsp) and there should be more than 0 documents in the index if you loaded the features properly.  Or look for documents in "http://localhost:8983/solr/development/select?q={!defType=dismax}*:*"http://localhost:8983/solr/development/select?q={!defType=dismax}*:*

Ensure Fedora is running:  "http://127.0.0.1:8983/fedora/describe":http://127.0.0.1:8983/fedora/describe should show the Fedora Repository Information View.  The following query should return objects:  "http://localhost:8983/fedora/objects?pid=true&title=true&terms=&query=&maxResults=20":http://localhost:8983/fedora/objects?pid=true&title=true&terms=&query=&maxResults=20

h4. (2.5) Import some Sample Content (other than fixtures??)

h4. (3) Start the Rails Application

<pre>
  ./script/server
</pre>  

To ensure the rails app is running, go to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/

h3. Ensure your Hydra App is set up properly

Run cucumber tests ... except they are for test, not development environment ...

h3. Exploring what comes out of the box

* log in, create sample account
* use facets
* run a search
* look at one of the sample objects
* edit one of the sample objects
* create a new MODS article …
* upload a file …
* change the permissions on the new article, making it visible to the public (before setting permissions, prove that you can’t see it when logged out, then change permissions, log out again & prove that it’s visible)


h2. Making local changes to your Hydra Application

In order to make it easy to get new functionality added to the hydra stack (see "README":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/blob/master/README.textile), while retaining your localizations, your local code should be set up to override the upstream Hydra stack code.

Luckily, rails engines has made this easy.  

1.  always write tests for your local modifications
2.  always change code at the app level, and never change anything in vendor/plugins.

h3.  tests tests tests

We STRONGLY recommend that you write tests for every local change you make.  This will allow you to ensure that upgrading the core code doesn't break any local changes you have made.

(when should it be a feature rather than a spec)
very basic rule:  if it's testing something created with view, use a cucumber feature to test.  If it's not created by view code, use a spec to test. 

h4. Run generator for specs

To create the infrastructure pieces to write specs:

<pre>
  ./script/generate rspec
</pre>

h4. Run generator for features

To create the infrastructure pieces to write cucumber features:

<pre>
  ./script/generate cucumber
</pre>


h3. Easy Changes for Practice.


h3. Changing the Home Text (also Demonstrates Writing a Feature)

The home text is set in the view partial (vendor/plugins/blah/)app/views/catalog/_home_text.html.erb

Because it is set in a view, a cucumber feature is the most appropriate test (rather than an rspec test).

h4. (1) Write the test.

Create a file "features/home_page.feature" containing this:

<pre>
  Feature: Homepage
    I want the home page to reflect localizations properly
</pre>

A test for checking the home text might be inserted like so:

<pre>
  Feature: Homepage
    I want the home page to reflect localizations properly
    
    Scenario: home page text
      When I am on the home page
      Then I should not see "override"
      And I should see "My Local Hydra App"
      And I should see "Isn't it great?"
      And I should see "Search"
</pre>

h4. (2) Run the test - it should fail

When you run this feature, the feature should run, but this test should fail (because you haven't changed anything yet.)

h4. (3) Change the code

We want to override the text on the home page locally, keeping our local changes separate from upstream changes to the plugins' code.

Since the home text is set in vendor/plugins/(blah)/app/views/catalog/_home_text.html.erb, we will override that code by creating a local app/views/catalog/_home_text.html.erb file.  

Our app/views/catalog/_home_text.html.erb might look like this

<pre>
<div id="results">
	
	<%= render :partial=>'search_form' %>
	
	<div class="home_text">
		<h1>Welcome to My Local Hydra App</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>This is my local Hydra application.  Isn't it great?
		</p>
	</div>

</div>
</pre>

h4. (4) Run the test - it should now pass

Now when you run the feature, it should pass.  If it doesn't, iterate until it does.


h3. Overriding a Helper Method (also Demonstrates Writing a Spec)

We want to change the application name (what displays as the html page's title).  This is set in a plugin's app/helper/application_helper.rb file.  Because it is set in a helper file, it is a good candidate for an rspec test (rather than a feature).

h4. (1) Write the test.

Since the application name is set in (vendor/plugins/blah/)app/helpers/application_helper.rb, we need a spec to run against the application_helper file.

Create a file "spec/helpers/application_helper_spec.rb" containing this:

<pre>
  require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helper')

  describe ApplicationHelper do
    include ApplicationHelper
  end
</pre>

A test for checking the application name might be inserted like so:

<pre>
  require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helper')

  describe ApplicationHelper do
    include ApplicationHelper

    describe "Overall UI methods" do
      it "should get the local application name" do
        application_name.should == "My Hydra"
      end
    end

  end
</pre>

h4. (2) Run the test - it should fail

When you run this spec, the spec should run, but this test should fail (because you haven't changed anything yet.)

h4. (3) Change the code

We want to override the application name locally, keeping our local changes separate from upstream changes to the plugins' code.

Since the application name is set in vendor/plugins/(blah)/app/helpers/application_helper.rb, we will override that code by putting a method of the same name in app/helpers/application_helper.rb.  The current app/helpers/application_helper.rb file may look like this:

<pre>
  require_plugin_dependency 'vendor/plugins/blacklight/app/helpers/application_helper.rb'
  # Methods added to this helper will be available to all templates in the application.
  module ApplicationHelper
  end
</pre>

Code for changing the application name might be inserted like so:

<pre>
  require_plugin_dependency 'vendor/plugins/blacklight/app/helpers/application_helper.rb'
  # Methods added to this helper will be available to all templates in the application.
  module ApplicationHelper

    def application_name
      'My Hydra'
    end

  end
</pre>

h4. (4) Run the test - it should now pass

Now when you run the spec, it should pass.  If it doesn't, iterate until it does.


h2. The new Content Type: JournalArticle

In this tutorial, we are creating a new JournalArticle content type.  This will allow us to create Journal Articles in a Fedora Repository, collect custom metadata for them, index them in solr, and display that custom metadata in the user interface.

In order to describe our Fedora objects, we can use whatever metadata schemas suit our needs.  Some metadata schemas currently being used in Hydra Heads include MODS, Dublin Core, EAD, PBcore, EAC-CPF and VRE.  This list continues to grow as people set up Hydra Heads to deal with their own specialized content.

The JournalArticle content type will use MODS (handily available in hydra-head) to track descriptive metadata about Articles.  Some of the metadata is common to many types of content:

* title
* author (first name, last name, role)
* abstract

Other metadata fields are more specifically relevant to journal articles, but they still fit into the MODS schema:

* journal title
* publication date
* journal volume
* journal issue
* start page
* end page

In addition to the MODS metadata, JournalArticle objects will use Hydra Rights Metadata to track information about licenses, rights, and which people/groups should be able to discover, view, and/or edit each Journal Article.

h2. Define the ActiveFedora Model for JournalArticles

The first thing to do when adding a new content type is to create the ActiveFedora Model.  This model is a Ruby class that uses ActiveFedora to tell the application the structure of your content and its metadata.

The model we create can be used in any application with ActiveFedora and OM (Opinionated Metadata), not just in a Hydra Head.  For example, ActiveFedora models can be used in batch scripts, command line utilities, and robots that perform automated actions on your fedora objects based on information and behaviors stored in their ActiveFedora models.

h4. Where to find the full tutorial on defining ActiveFedora Models

This tutorial will only cover the very basics of defining an ActiveFedora Model and defining OM terminologies for its XML datastreams.  For a complete introduction to those topics, see the  "ActiveFedora Console Tour":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/active_fedora/Documentation/file.CONSOLE_GETTING_STARTED.html and the tutorials included in the "OM documentation":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/om/Documentation/.

h3. Tests to Define Expected Behaviors

(<b>MUST HAVE EXAMPLES HERE PERTINENT TO EXPECTED JOURNAL ARTICLE BEHAVIORS</b>)

h4. Run the tests

The test code should execute but the tests should fail because we haven't written the code yet.

h3. Defining the Datastreams

A Fedora object is made up of any number of _datastreams_.  Datastreams can have content of any type and each datastream is identified by a _datastream id_ or _dsid_.  The ActiveFedora model tells us which datastreams to expect or create in an object and tells us what kind of content is expected inside each datastream.

For our JournalArticle model, we're particularly interested datastreams with XML content because a JournalArticle object is basically a container for XML metadata.  The actual content of the Article (PDF,text,whatever.) will be stored in a separate Fedora object, a _primitive_, with the RDF isPartOf relationship connecting the JournalArticle (primarily metadata) to its content (any number of primitives with files in them).  For more information about datastreams, primitives, and where the actual content of an object lives, see the Reference links at the end of this tutorial.

h3. descMetadata -- the Descriptive Metadata Datastream

Our MODS xml will go into a datastream with the datastream id of _descMetadata_.  Technically, we could give it any name we want but the Hydra community has come up with some conventions to make things simpler.  One of these conventions is to always put descriptive metadata in a datastream called descMetadata.

As we said above, we want to create MODS metadata that keeps track of title, author (first name/last name/role), publication date, abstract, journal title, journal volume, journal issue, start page and end page.  In order to do this we will use ActiveFedora to define a special type of Ruby object that uses OM to read and modify XML.

Example of the MODS XML we will be creating:

<pre>
<mods xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3" version="3.0"  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3
     http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-0.xsd">
   <titleInfo>
       <title>ARTICLE TITLE</title>                                   <!-- title -->
   </titleInfo>
   <name type="personal">
       <namePart type="family">FAMILY NAME</namePart>                 <!-- author last name -->
       <namePart type="given">GIVEN NAMES</namePart>                  <!-- author first name -->
       <role> 
           <roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="text">Creator</roleTerm> <!-- author role -->
       </role>
   </name>
   <abstract>ABSTRACT</abstract>                                    <!-- abstract -->
   <relatedItem type="host">
       <titleInfo>
           <title>TITLE OF HOST JOURNAL</title>                     <!-- journal title -->
       </titleInfo>
       <part>
           <detail type="volume">
               <number>2</number>                                   <!-- journal volume -->
           </detail>
           <detail type="level">
               <number>2</number>                                   <!-- journal issue -->
           </detail>
           <extent unit="pages">
               <start>195</start>                                   <!-- start page -->
               <end>230</end>                                       <!-- end page -->
           </extent>
           <date>FEB. 2007</date>                                   <!-- publication date -->
       </part>
    </relatedItem>
</mods>
</pre>

The constraints of a metadata schema sometimes force us to put information into structures that don't map directly to the vocabulary that we use when talking about that information.  The "title" has ended up in a spot that you might call the "mods titleInfo title" and the "start page" has ended up in a spot that you might call the <pre>"mods host-relatedItem part pages-extent start"</pre> or <pre>"//mods/relatedItem[@type=host]/part/extent[@unit='pages']/start"</pre> ... quite the mouthful, isn't it?  This is where OM comes in.  OM lets us define a Terminology that will allow us to access values in the xml based on our natural vocabulary (title, start page, etc.) while also allowing us to access those same values using the more cumbersome XML-speak when necessary.

h4. WRITE TESTS HERE!  (for the expected behaviors of a descMetadata datastream model?)

specs to test model?  features?

h4. Coding the descMetadata Datastream model

Here's how we define the datastream class for the descMetadata.  Notice that we use set_terminology which defines its OM Terminology.  

<b><i>Create a new file in app/models called journal_article_mods_datastream.rb</i></b> and put this into it (NOTE: you could also save this file as lib/journal_article_mods_datastream.rb and get the same results):

<pre>
# a Fedora Datastream object containing Mods XML for the descMetadata 
# datastream in the Journal Article hydra content type, defined using 
# ActiveFedora and OM.

class JournalArticleModsDatastream < ActiveFedora::NokogiriDatastream

  # OM (Opinionated Metadata) terminology mapping for the mods xml
  set_terminology do |t|
    t.root(:path=>"mods", :xmlns=>"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3", :schema=>"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-2.xsd")
    t.title_info(:path=>"titleInfo") {
      t.main_title(:index_as=>[:facetable],:path=>"title", :label=>"title")
    }
    t.author {
      t.first_name(:path=>"namePart", :attributes=>{:type=>"given"})
      t.last_name(:path=>"namePart", :attributes=>{:type=>"family"})
      t.role {
        t.text(:path=>"roleTerm",:attributes=>{:type=>"text"})
      }
    }
    t.abstract 
    t.journal(:path=>'relatedItem', :attributes=>{:type=>"host"}) {
      t.title_info(:ref=>[:title_info])
      t.issue(:path=>"part") {
        t.volume(:path=>"detail", :attributes=>{:type=>"volume"}, :default_content_path=>"number")
        t.level(:path=>"detail", :attributes=>{:type=>"number"}, :default_content_path=>"number")
        t.pages(:path=>"extent", :attributes=>{:unit=>"pages"}) {
          t.start
          t.end
        }
        t.date
      }
    }
      
    # these proxy declarations allow you to use more familiar term/field names that hide the details of the XML structure
    t.title(:proxy=>[:title_info, :main_title])
    t.start_page(:proxy=>[:journal, :issue, :pages, :start])
    t.end_page(:proxy=>[:journal, :issue, :pages, :end])
    t.publication_date(:proxy=>[:journal, :issue, :date])

  end # set_terminology

end # class
</pre>

This will allow you to access the metadata values like this when dealing with a JournalArticleModsDatastream object:

<pre>
  ds.term_values(:author, :first_name)
  ds.term_values(:start_page)
  ds.term_values(:journal, :issue, :pages, :start)  # same result as the previous line, but more detailed reference to the xml node
</pre>

<b>(CAN WE DO TESTING NOW?  OR DO WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ENTIRE FEDORA OBJECT BEFORE TESTING?)</b>

h3. rightsMetadata -- The Hydra Rights Metadata Datastream

The hydra-head plugin provides a class definition for the rightsMetadata datastream, so you won't have to define the OM Terminology yourself.  The definition is in the hydra-head plugin code in "lib/hydra/rights_metadata.rb":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/blob/master/lib/hydra/rights_metadata.rb.

Here's an example of what rightsMetadata XML looks like:

<pre>

</pre>

h3. RELS-EXT & DC Datastreams (Fedora defaults)

There are two special datastreams that Fedora creates for you -- the DC datastream and the RELS-EXT datastream.  We don't really use the DC datastream.  It contains simple Dublin Core metadata that mainly exists for Fedora's internal use.  The RELS-EXT datastream contains RDF representing the relationships between the objects in a Fedora repository.  ActiveFedora and Hydra both use these RDF relationships in a number of ways.  For more information about how to work with RDF relationships in ActiveFedora, see the ActiveFedora documentation links at the end of this tutorial.

h2. Defining the Model and adding the Datastreams to it

<b><i>Create a file in app/models called journal_article.rb</i></b> and put these lines into it:

<pre>
# a Fedora object for the Journal Article hydra content type
class JournalArticle < ActiveFedora::Base
  has_metadata :name => "descMetadata", :type=> JournalArticleModsDatastream
  has_metadata :name => "rightsMetadata", :type => Hydra::RightsMetadata
end
</pre>

<b>(CAN WE DO TESTING NOW?)</b>


h2. Test Your Work

<b>THE TESTS WE WROTE ABOVE SHOULD PASS NOW ...</b>

(specs?  if features ... jetty must be running?)

h2. Loading your new Model in the Rails App

If you have put the new files you've created into app/models and/or the lib directory, then they will be automatically loaded by the application when you run it using script/server or script/console.

h2. Creating new JournalArticle Objects

Start up Fedora and Solr on port 8983, assuming they are not already running:

<pre>rake hydra:jetty:start</pre>

Create a JournalArticle object using the console (rather than from the UI of the rails app)

<pre>script/console</pre>

Type these lines at the console command line:

<pre>
  article = JournalArticle.new
  article.save
  # In case you're curious, explore a bit...
  article.pid
  article.datastreams.keys
  article.datastreams["descMetadata"].class
  article.datastreams["rightsMetadata"].class
  article.relationships
</pre>

h2.  Getting metadata into JournalArticle Objects

h2. Index JournalArticles into Solr

By default, ActiveFedora automatically updates Solr whenever you save an object to Fedora.  If you want to re-index it, all you have to do is load an instance of the object and call its update_index method.  For example, if you wanted to update an object that has a pid "changeme:30", you could do it like this:

<pre>
  article = JournalArticle.load_instance("changeme:30")
  article.update_index
</pre>

In reality, when you want to re-index an object in Solr, you should use Solrizer.  Solrizer is specifically designed to help you keep your solr indexes up to date.

"Solrizer Documentation":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/solrizer/Documentation/

"Solrizer on GitHub":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/om/Documentation/ https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer

Solrizer is able to figure out how to index XML based on the OM Terminologies you've defined.  It defaults to indexing nearly everything in generic ways, but there are many ways to customize this behavior. See the "Solrizer Documentation":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/solrizer/Documentation/ for more information about how it works.

* rightsMetadata (recommended): Rights, License, and Permissions information.  Hydra rightsMetadata XML is recommended.
h4. Understanding Parts (Where will my uploaded files go?)

h5. Primitives contain actual files

bq. A primitive is a fundamental atom object that bears an actual file payload. They are single, (near-) universal content types which may either stand-alone or be incorporated into higher order content types (in a book or ETD, e.g.).

h5. Higher Level Objects

bq. Higher Level Objects represent higher-level, molecular objects that may have primitives and/or other Higher-level objects as children.

h5. Relationships

"isPartOf":info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relations-external#isPartOf -- Hydra reserves this predicate for use in representing part-whole relationships between objects.  This occurs most often when representing which Primitives (ie. an uploaded PDF) are _part_ of a Higher Level object (ie. a MODS Article)
