Feature: File downloading via links in views
  In order to be able to get actual files
  As a user
  I want file download links to work
  
  # This needs to be re-written to verify that the correct file download link is being generated.
  # Scenario: FTK file downloads work from ftk item
  #   Given context
  #   When I am on the document page for id "hypatia:fixture_ftk_item_factory"
  #   Then I should see a link to "fixture_ftk_file_factory/downloads?download_id=DS1"
